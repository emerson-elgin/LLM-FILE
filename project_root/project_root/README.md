## **Project Overview**

Welcome to the **LLM-Based File Management System**, an advanced file management system that utilizes machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to manage and interact with files more efficiently. The system uses large language models (LLMs) to understand user queries and perform complex file management tasks, such as file categorization, duplication detection, summarization, and more.

### **Core Features**
- **Natural Language Queries**: Users can search for files using natural language queries like "Find all project-related PDFs from last month."
- **File Categorization**: Automatically group files by type, date, or content.
- **File Summarization**: Summarize large files (e.g., documents, PDFs) for quick review.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identify duplicate files and suggest removal or consolidation.
- **Advanced Search**: Perform semantic searches to find files based on content, not just file names.

---

## **Features**

### **1. Natural Language Search**
- Leverage LLMs for file search using natural language queries.
- Example: "Find all images I uploaded last week."

### **2. File Categorization and Organization**
- Organize files into logical categories (e.g., project documents, images, etc.).
- Ability to group files based on metadata like creation date, size, and file type.

### **3. File Summarization**
- Use advanced summarization models (e.g., BART, Pegasus) to summarize long documents, PDFs, or text files.
- Extract key points and provide quick insights into the content.

### **4. Duplicate Detection**
- Use semantic search and similarity matching to find duplicate files.
- Suggest potential removals or consolidation of files.

### **5. Disk Usage Insights**
- Analyze disk usage and identify large files, unused files, or unnecessary duplicates.
- Provide statistics and insights on storage efficiency.

Key Components:
API Layer (Python, FastAPI):
Exposes endpoints for file management and LLM queries.
LLM & AI Layer (Python, Transformers):
Handles NLP tasks and interactions with the file management system.
Core File System (Rust):
Performs file operations and optimizations with high efficiency.
Storage Layer:
Manages local and cloud storage for files and metadata.
Installation
Follow the steps below to set up the system on your local machine:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/llm-file-management-system.git
cd llm-file-management-system
2. Set Up the Backend
Install Dependencies
Python 3.8+ is required.

Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
Install Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up PostgreSQL
Install PostgreSQL.
Create a database and apply the schema:
bash
Copy code
psql -U postgres -d your_database -f db/db_schema.sql
Run the FastAPI App
bash
Copy code
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to explore the API.

3. Set Up Rust Core
Install Rust.
Navigate to the rust_core directory and build the project:
bash
Copy code
cargo build --release
Running the Project
Once all dependencies are installed, you can run the backend (FastAPI) and the Rust core components. Here's how:

Run FastAPI (Backend):

bash
Copy code
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload
This will start the FastAPI server, and you can access it via http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Run Rust Core:

Build the project using cargo build --release.
Call Rust functions (like file operations) from the Python API layer.
API Endpoints
The API exposes several endpoints for interacting with the file management system:

Endpoint	Method	Description
/files/list	GET	List files in a directory
/files/upload	POST	Upload a file to the system
/files/search	GET	Search for files based on metadata
/files/semantic_search	GET	Search files semantically using LLM
/files/summarize	POST	Summarize the content of a file
